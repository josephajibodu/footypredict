# FootyPredict

For every model, I decorate the docs with the properties it has, this way the IDE gives the necessary autocomplete, 
hence a better developer experience. Little work for a bigger gain. So as you work on this project, when you add more
properties to any model, add it to the docs at the top.

Do well to format your code at intervals with composer format
