# FootyPredict

For every model, I decorate the docs with the properties it has, this way the IDE gives the necessary autocomplete, 
hence a better developer experience. Little work for a bigger gain. So as you work on this project, when you add more
properties to any model, add it to the docs at the top.

Do well to format your code at intervals with composer format


# For deployments

It's usually very good to update general codes first. For instance, update your .env first in production before pushing the new update.
This way, all that the system needs are ready. It applies for other things.
